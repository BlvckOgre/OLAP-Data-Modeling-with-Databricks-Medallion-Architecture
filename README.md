# OLAP-Data-Modeling-with-Databricks-Medallion-Architecture
This project simulates a real-world data engineering workflow. It focuses on building a complete OLAP data model using the Medallion architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold layers) on Databricks, while implementing best practices like ETL pipelines, parameterized SQL, and Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD Type 1 &amp; Type 2).
